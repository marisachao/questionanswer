          <h2>MAP</h2>
          <p>Washington University's main campus is located in the suburbs of St. Louis. The size of the campus is very manageable as it takes only 15 minutes to walk from one end to the other. Students can find their way to particular buildings using the school's map app which is a function of the <a href="https://sts.wustl.edu/services/mobile-applications/">WUSTL app</a>. Washington University's campus also lies next to the Delmar Loop and Forest Park. The Loop is a great place to go out to eat or do some shopping. Forest Park is the perfect place to enjoy a nice day outside. Numerous museums and the city's zoo can also be found within the park.</p>
